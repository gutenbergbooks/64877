<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
CHURCH AND THE CENSUS.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">desire</span> to say what follows, in
all earnestness, to my fellow-countrymen who have been, through
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> goodness, baptized into
the Church of England.&nbsp; I shall be thankful, also, if others
will patiently consider what is here set down.</p>
<p>There can be no question that, in old times, <span
class="smcap">God</span> was pleased to set up a visible token,
whereby the world might be convinced of His power and love.&nbsp;
And this token was also a witness to <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Truth.&nbsp; No one doubts that
the Jewish Church and nation were the witnesses of <span
class="smcap">God</span>; and that they were His witnesses by His
own express appointment.&nbsp; It is equally allowed, on all
hands, that the Jewish Church and nation failed in their
witness.&nbsp; They <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>failed&mdash;not because the need of witnessing had been
taken away; or their authority to witness had been
loosened.&nbsp; But they failed, because, having the power of
choice free&mdash;to stand by <span class="smcap">God</span> or
to desert Him, they chose to desert Him.&nbsp; They failed,
because they chose to blind themselves to the need of
witnessing.&nbsp; They failed, because they chose to set at
nought that authority to witness with which they had been
clothed.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> law of
always having His witness did not fail.&nbsp; The very failure of
the Jewish Church and nation, in the place of witness, <i>was</i>
a witness.&nbsp; The Jewish Church and nation could desert its
place of witness.&nbsp; It could prefer its own will to <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> will.&nbsp; It could prefer the
will of the people to the will of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; It could prefer the kingdom of
this world to the kingdom of Heaven.&nbsp; And it <i>did</i>
prefer its own will, and the will of the people, and the kingdom
of this world.</p>
<p>Look at the prophecy of Hosea, and what is there said of all
Israel in the name of Ephraim.&nbsp; Read the seventh
chapter.&nbsp; The Prophet is reproving the sins of the princes,
and the great men of Israel.&nbsp; &ldquo;All their kings are
fallen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The flame of civil discord has spread, and
dried <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>up the
sources of legitimate authority among them.&nbsp; An anarchy of
eleven years, after the death of Jeroboam II., has terminated in
the assassination of Zachariah and his successors Shallum and
Pekahiah.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet there is none among them that
calleth unto Me,&rdquo; saith the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>
<p>And then, he denounces judgment against the people in the
mass, for their hypocrisy and unfaithfulness.&nbsp; Whereas, by
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> institution, they were a
peculiar people,&mdash;witnesses for <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and separate from the world,
&ldquo;they have mixed themselves among the
people,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, among the idolaters of the
land,&mdash;they are &ldquo;as a cake not turned,&rdquo; as a
cake baked only on one side; serving <span
class="smcap">God</span> by halves, halting between two masters;
worshipping <span class="smcap">God</span> a little, and
worshipping idols a little, and worshipping nothing much.&nbsp;
And so, as a consequence, what must have followed, <i>did</i>
follow.&nbsp; The Syrians, in the time of Jehoahaz, reduced them
to great straits.&nbsp; They had but fifty horsemen and ten
chariots, and ten thousand footmen. <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; They were
&ldquo;made like the dust by threshing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly
after, in the days of Menahem, they <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>became tributaries to Pul, king of
Assyria. <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; And at length they were carried
away captive bodily by Shalmaneser.</p>
<p>Now, all this has a forcible application to a spiritual state
of things, and sets forth the condition of the Church in the
world, as at other times, so especially at this time in which we
live.</p>
<p>Ephraim is the witness of <span
class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;testifying <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Truth,&mdash;bearing <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> commission&mdash;appointed in
the world to win and attract the people,&mdash;to draw them
upward, far above worldly measures of things to the divine
measure of things&mdash;to the things which shall be in the
eternal Future, and to the fixed and unchangeable will of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, on which that eternal Future
stands.&nbsp; But &ldquo;Ephraim hath mixed himself&rdquo; with
the people,&mdash;he has &ldquo;learned their
inventions,&rdquo;&mdash;he has adapted his witness to their
demands,&mdash;he has lowered his standard of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> appointment to the
people&rsquo;s standard of human construction.&nbsp; So that
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> teaching and man&rsquo;s
teaching have become confused and indifferently accepted, and
they who have fallen into grave errors of faith are in no sense
differently esteemed from those <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>who have maintained the truth as
revealed by <span class="smcap">God</span>, and as witnessed by
the Church in every land, in every age, by every tongue.</p>
<p>And so, the spiritual Ephraim, who was set up for a witness to
the truth, has become &ldquo;a cake not turned,&rdquo; a
half-equipped soldier in the fight, with but half a heart to his
Master&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>What is the occasion which now presses?&nbsp; While many of us
are praising <span class="smcap">God</span> in grateful love for
His unspeakable mercy in vouchsafing us His Truth&mdash;His
determinate and fixed Truth&mdash;in which alone souls are
saved&mdash;His Truth, as divinely committed to the Church
&ldquo;the pillar and ground of the Truth,&rdquo;&mdash;and
handed down from age to age in every land,&mdash;His Truth as
mercifully retained and maintained in the Prayer Book of the
Church of England,&mdash;set forth with categorical precision in
the three Creeds of universal Christendom, and expanded and
applied in the offices of Holy Baptism and the Communion of the
Body and Blood of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;while
we are keeping solemn festival to the Glory of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and the power of His Truth, the
&ldquo;religious world&rdquo; is exciting itself with vexing
hopes and fears about the decennial <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Census which the State is about to
take of the religious condition of the country.</p>
<p>I do not believe that this question excites churchmen, or that
they care, except as a matter of political justice, what becomes
of it.&nbsp; For themselves they know what they are, and where
they stand, and in Whom they trust.&nbsp; And they are
&ldquo;ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh
them a reason of the hope that is in them.&rdquo;&nbsp; With no
&ldquo;uncertain sound,&rdquo; or doubting heart, but with
plainness and boldness, as Christian men and women,
&ldquo;standing fast in one spirit, with one mind striving
together for the faith of the Gospel, and nothing terrified by
their adversaries.&rdquo; <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p>But it is a question full of importance, because of the
evidence which it draws out of the condition of men&rsquo;s minds
among whom we live, and because of the lesson which that evidence
reads to ourselves.</p>
<p>I do not enter upon the question whether it is right or wrong
for the state to ask people about their religion.&nbsp; My own
conviction is that, under the distracting circumstances of
religion in this country, it would be better and <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>wiser for the
state to abstain.&nbsp; And yet in common sense the state may as
well demand information as to my religious profession, as in
respect of my age or worldly calling.&nbsp; But the question
having been raised, what is this evidence which it has brought to
light, and which I say is so grave in its results?&nbsp; There is
a vehement, almost a <i>passionate</i> resistance of the
proposition, that men should give an account of their faith.</p>
<p>It is true that <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, the
very Saviour and Redeemer of our souls, has said,
&ldquo;Whosoever shall confess Me <i>before men</i>, him will I
confess also before My <span class="smcap">Father</span> which is
in heaven; and whosoever shall deny Me <i>before men</i>, him
will I also deny before My <span class="smcap">Father</span>
which is in heaven.&rdquo; <a name="citation9a"></a><a
href="#footnote9a" class="citation">[9a]</a>&nbsp; But people on
all sides are saying, &ldquo;not so&mdash;not before
men,&mdash;religion is a private and secret matter between <span
class="smcap">God</span> and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that holy David declared that &ldquo;he would
<i>speak</i> even before kings and not be ashamed,&rdquo; <a
name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a> that S. John Baptist &ldquo;confessed
and denied not, but confessed;&rdquo; <a name="citation9c"></a><a
href="#footnote9c" class="citation">[9c]</a> that S. Paul, for
himself, &ldquo;continued <i>witnessing</i> to small and <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>great,&rdquo;
<a name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a> and in the name of all Christians laid
it down that &ldquo;we believe and <i>therefore speak</i>,&rdquo;
<a name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a> and that &ldquo;every <i>tongue</i>
should confess.&rdquo; <a name="citation10c"></a><a
href="#footnote10c" class="citation">[10c]</a>&nbsp; But people
on all sides are saying, &ldquo;Not so&mdash;not confess, not
witness, not speak,&mdash;any other test you please; number us as
we sit here or stand there; but do not ask us to speak.&nbsp; We
prefer to take our place with the &lsquo;chief rulers who
believed, but did not confess;&rsquo;&mdash;we believe, but do
not ask us to confess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this resistance has two sides&mdash;one political, and the
other quasi-religious.</p>
<p>Political men resist, because they say the Church of England
holds them, and yet does <i>not</i> hold them.&nbsp; It holds
them politically, gives them, if they demand it, baptism, or
communion, or churching, or burial.&nbsp; Yet it does <i>not</i>
hold them because they object to her services, and usages, and
prefer preachers of their own, and <i>other</i> doctrines than
hers.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are Churchmen,&rdquo; say these people,
&ldquo;in one sense, though not in another; and therefore we
prefer not to define ourselves at all.&nbsp; We go to
&lsquo;meeting,&rsquo; but we have not parted final company with
the Church.&nbsp; And as excommunication <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>can alone
sever the bond between us, we are glad that excommunication is
now unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is one side of the opposition to the notion of defining
their faith.&nbsp; How shall they define it?&nbsp; Once perhaps
when the Catechism was fresh upon the soft and docile mind of
their childhood they might have been able, but now that is a mere
reminiscence.&nbsp; They know not to-day what they may believe
to-morrow.&nbsp; Meantime they will hold on to the Church as to a
secular institution, and do what they can to secularize it.&nbsp;
It will become more useful and less mischievous in their opinion,
just as men cease to regard it as a &ldquo;witness&rdquo; for the
glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and a training school
for the salvation of souls.</p>
<p>The other side of the same opposition has more appearance of
religious feeling about it.&nbsp; Men object to define their
faith, because really and conscientiously they <i>have</i> no
faith which they <i>can</i> define.&nbsp; &ldquo;False
shame,&rdquo; &ldquo;procrastination,&rdquo; &ldquo;self-distrust
in honourable minds,&rdquo; (as it has been mischievously called,
<a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a>) &ldquo;consciousness of
imperfection,&rdquo; such are the pleas with which <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>they
indulgently flatter themselves.&nbsp; They are not yet ripe for
any &ldquo;visible Church;&rdquo; so they ignorantly and
complacently express it; they mean to wait; they are not
unchristian because they dare not make choice of a denomination
<i>yet</i>.&nbsp; Surely not.&nbsp; By and by will be time
enough.&nbsp; They will make a profession some day though not
now.</p>
<p>When I hear on every side as I mix with my fellow men, and
read in every newspaper, as I strive to note down the voice of
the public press as it gains upon the popular mind, such
sentiments as these, I am bound to say that if this be not
spiritually the reproduction of the picture of Ephraim, as Hosea
drew it in the days of Israel&rsquo;s apostasy, and as such, if
it be not the accomplishment among ourselves of a prophetic
announcement which spiritually concerned the Church of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, I know not where to find a prophecy
fulfilled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ephraim he hath mixed himself among the
people: Ephraim is a cake not turned.&nbsp; Strangers have
devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not; yea, grey hairs are
here and there upon him; yet he knoweth not.&rdquo; <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>I will
now presume to say something in the presence of this calamity
which afflicts the Church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in
England.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; First, I will say that as Truth is one and
indivisible, so your faith as English Churchmen, with the Cross
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> upon your
foreheads,&mdash;and the bond of the &ldquo;Apostles&rsquo;
doctrine and fellowship&rdquo; in your hearts,&mdash;and the
Prayer Book with its Catholic witness in your hands, is fixed,
and easily defined.</p>
<p>It is fixed, because otherwise it could not be the
Truth.&nbsp; And you possess that which is fixed, because
otherwise that which you possess could not be true.&nbsp; The
Church of <span class="smcap">God</span> is &ldquo;the pillar and
ground of the Truth;&rdquo; <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a> and you have the
Truth from the Church of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>The Church of <span class="smcap">God</span> does not create
the Truth.&nbsp; The Church of <span class="smcap">God</span>
does not even give force and power to the Truth.&nbsp; But the
Church of <span class="smcap">God</span> is the depositary of the
Truth.&nbsp; The Church of <span class="smcap">God</span> has the
Truth to keep, and to maintain, and to hand down.&nbsp; The
Church of <span class="smcap">God</span> is the orb, out of which
the glorious light of the Truth shines and overspreads the
earth.&nbsp; The Church of <span class="smcap">God</span> is the
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>candlestick which holds the light.&nbsp; The Church of
<span class="smcap">God</span> is the pillar on which the
proclamation of the Truth is written, and held up and heralded
through the world.&nbsp; You learn truth from that pillar.&nbsp;
And that pillar is the Church of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?</p>
<p>What Church of <span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; The one
Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; The same which delivered the
&ldquo;decrees of the Apostles and elders at Jerusalem:&rdquo; <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> the same which confounded Arius at
Nic&aelig;a: the same which overwhelmed Nestorius at Ephesus: the
same which silenced Macedonius at Constantinople: the same which
vanquished Eutyches at Chalcedon:&mdash;the one Holy Church
throughout the world.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Next, I desire to lay down this&mdash;that, contrary
to what the advocates of a religious census seem to
imply&mdash;truth and numbers have no relation one to the other,
unless it be that truth is with the few.&nbsp; The greatest
number of mankind is yet in darkness and error; as S. John says,
&ldquo;the world lieth in wickedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Word testifies
that, compared with the many who forsake the truth, or who never
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>accept it,
or who deny it and lose its fruits, those who receive it, and
live by it, and enter into its reward, are few.&nbsp; Of all the
world at the time of the Flood only eight persons were worthy to
be rescued.&nbsp; Among all the guilty families in the cities of
the plain, only Lot&rsquo;s escaped destruction.&nbsp; Of all the
six hundred thousand Hebrews delivered out of Egypt, though
blessed with the same miracles, conducted by the same Guide, and
nourished by the same Manna, two only entered the promised
land.&nbsp; In the taking of Jericho, of all the houses in the
city only the harlot Rahab&rsquo;s was spared.&nbsp; Of all the
thirty and two thousand soldiers of Gideon, but three hundred
were found worthy to contend for the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; And so, of all those olive
berries and clusters of grapes set forth by the Prophet to
describe the called of <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;there shall be saved only
&ldquo;as the shaking of the olive tree, and as the gleaning
grapes, when the vintage is done.&rdquo; <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a></p>
<p>Therefore Religion is not for show, but for reality.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">God</span> is for Truth, and not for
numbers.&nbsp; And they who are truly wise must be content, as
the Apostles of old were content, to have <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>numbers
against them, if so it be, and to pass in turn through good and
evil report, in the honest and simple defence of what is
true.</p>
<p>This facing of the Truth against numbers is a necessity.&nbsp;
And if you seek to shun it, you are sure nevertheless to
encounter it; and with all the more roughness, for your efforts
to escape it.&nbsp; If you side with the multitude, you will
probably be magnified by those who are in the wrong.&nbsp; But
you will hardly escape being censured by those who are in the
right.&nbsp; And their commendation, if it makes less noise, has
more value.</p>
<p>You must not be dismayed, therefore, because the world is
against you.&nbsp; You must not begin a course of action because
it is popular; nor must you abandon a course of action because it
is decried.&nbsp; Look to what pleases <span
class="smcap">God</span>, not to what will please the
multitude.&nbsp; And then you will do what is right.&nbsp; You
will be wise for <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; And <span
class="smcap">God</span> is over all.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Once more.&nbsp; No earnest mind can entertain the
thought of what is passing among us, without feeling that these
are sifting times.&nbsp; Times of division, when errors abound,
are always times of sifting; times in which <span
class="smcap">God</span> is <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>trying what men are made of; whether
they are corn or chaff, gold or dross, wheat or tares.</p>
<p>Ephraim is &ldquo;a cake not turned.&rdquo;&nbsp; But who are
guilty?&nbsp; &ldquo;I will sift the House of Israel,&rdquo;
saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, &ldquo;as corn is
sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="citation17a"></a><a
href="#footnote17a" class="citation">[17a]</a>&nbsp; This is the
one comfort in the midst of so much sorrow.&nbsp; Whosoever is
true grain, shall not be lost.&nbsp; See to it, then, that each
soul among you is <i>true grain</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">God</span> is sifting your sincerity by
the errors which He suffers to compass you about.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
hear there are divisions among you, and I believe it,&rdquo; says
the Apostle, &ldquo;for there <i>must</i> be heresies among you,
that they which are approved may be made manifest.&rdquo; <a
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a>&nbsp; And your stability He is
sifting&mdash;whether or not you are as Reuben, &ldquo;unstable
as water,&rdquo; weak, and soft, and yielding, and
inconstant.&nbsp; And your zeal, and your knowledge, and your
love,&mdash;He is sifting all these, in this your day of
probation.</p>
<p>You have had great gifts at <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Hand, unspeakable opportunities
of knowing Him and His Truth&mdash;the Word of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the witness of <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the Church,
and the &ldquo;Spirit leading you into all Truth&rdquo; through
the ordained means of grace&mdash;through Sacraments and
Prayer.&nbsp; How is it with you?&nbsp; Are you yet
&ldquo;men&rdquo; in knowledge, with the &ldquo;full assurance of
understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and of the <span
class="smcap">Father</span>, and of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, in Whom are hid all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge.&rdquo; <a name="citation18a"></a><a
href="#footnote18a" class="citation">[18a]</a>&nbsp; Or are you
&ldquo;children in understanding,&rdquo; &ldquo;tossed to and fro
and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of
men, and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to
deceive?&rdquo; <a name="citation18b"></a><a href="#footnote18b"
class="citation">[18b]</a></p>
<p>Now is the test of your weakness or of your strength.&nbsp;
Now it will be seen <i>who</i> is possessed by that enervated and
timid spirit which inspires so many faltering hearts, and directs
so many enfeebled wills, in this day of conflict for the Church
of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>And, above all, your love is being sifted.&nbsp; Is your hold
upon the Church and her teaching &ldquo;rooted and grounded in
love?&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> is trying your
<i>love</i>&mdash;your love to Himself, to <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, to the Truth.&nbsp; The head is not
a casket in which Truth can safely lie enshrined.&nbsp; It is <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>soon stolen
from thence.&nbsp; But, if you have lodged it in the heart, and
embedded it there in folds of love, men may take out your heart,
but out of your heart they cannot take the Truth.</p>
<p>It is for want of love that so many men among us are
cowards,&mdash;that so much is sacrificed to the first appearance
of danger,&mdash;that so much is offered up to expediency, to
popularity, to success.&nbsp; The world is a worshipper of
success.&nbsp; But the world has no love for the Truth.&nbsp; The
world knows nothing of the blessed joy of undergoing persecution
and danger, and making ventures, for the Truth&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; And so, as &ldquo;Ephraim has mixed himself&rdquo;
with the world, he is as &ldquo;a cake not turned,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;strangers have devoured his strength,&rdquo; in this age
of concession and falling away.</p>
<p>But what says &ldquo;He Who sitteth upon the
throne?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that overcometh shall inherit all
things.&rdquo; <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; But the &ldquo;fearful&rdquo; or
cowardly, (the
<i>&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&#8054;</i>,) and the
unfaithful or &ldquo;unbelieving&rdquo; (the
<i>&#7940;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&iota;</i>,) the
deserters who fall off from want of faith and patience, what of
them? &ldquo;they shall have their part with murderers, and
whore-mongers, <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>and idolaters, and liars, in the lake which burns with
fire and brimstone, which is the second death.&rdquo; <a
name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a></p>
<p>And what says the Apostle?&nbsp; When love is perfect <a
name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a> then we have &ldquo;boldness in the
<i>crisis</i>,&rdquo; or judgment, or trial, of faith; and
&ldquo;love casts out fear.&rdquo;&nbsp; And fear is the parent
of all unlawful concessions.</p>
<p>We owe the Truth an external service as well as an internal
devotion.&nbsp; And they have no love for the Truth who withhold
an external service.&nbsp; The faith of the heart will no more
avail without the confession of the mouth, than the confession of
the mouth will avail without the faith of the heart.</p>
<p>If it be enough for <span class="smcap">Christ</span> that you
know Him, though you confess Him not before men, it will also be
enough for you that He knows you, though, at the last, He confess
you not before men.&nbsp; It is not enough to say, &ldquo;I hold
the Truth in my heart, but I am silent before the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, therefore, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> does <i>not</i> say, &ldquo;he that
confesseth Me in his heart;&rdquo; but <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> says, &ldquo;he that confesseth Me
<i>before men</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are vital words, these words
of <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span><span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; Lay them up in your hearts,
and live by them.&nbsp; Hear them at length.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whosoever shall confess Me before men, him will I confess
also before My <span class="smcap">Father</span> Which is in
Heaven.&nbsp; But whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I
also deny before My <span class="smcap">Father</span> Which is in
Heaven.&nbsp; Think not that I am come to send peace on earth, I
came not to send peace but a sword.&nbsp; For I am come to set a
man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her
mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, and a
man&rsquo;s foes shall be they of his own household.&nbsp; He
that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me;
and he that loveth son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of
Me.&nbsp; And he that taketh not his cross and followeth after Me
is not worthy of Me.&nbsp; He that findeth his life shall lose
it, and he that loseth his life for My sake shall find it.&rdquo;

<h2><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>POSTSCRIPT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">While</span> these pages are passing
through the press, the Government has yielded the point at
issue.&nbsp; It has yielded, against its own convictions.&nbsp;
It has yielded to pressure,&mdash;and to pressure from those whom
it considers wrong-headed, and unreasonable, and unjust.</p>
<p>The Government believed and declared that it was fair, and
right, and just, and necessary &ldquo;for legislative
purposes,&rdquo; that the people of England should <i>confess</i>
the religious profession which they make&mdash;each man his
own.&nbsp; The Government still believes in the fairness, and
justice, and necessity of such a declaration.&nbsp; But, because
some persons object to it, on the ground that no man ought to be
asked what his religion is, or whether he has any religion at
all, and because those persons have political influence, the
Government has yielded its convictions to those persons.</p>
<p>The Government loves its convictions a little.&nbsp; It loves
political influence much.&nbsp; And so, this has come <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>out
clear&mdash;whatever is just, and fair, and right, and even
necessary for &ldquo;legislative purposes,&rdquo; has no chance
of prevailing in the counsels of Government, unless,
<i>first</i>, the political influence of the Government shall be
secured.&nbsp; If on the side of injustice, and unfairness, and
the entanglement and perversion of legislation, there should be
political influence, that will be the side of the
Government.&nbsp; Evil consequences in the future are
nothing.&nbsp; Present place and present power are
everything.</p>
<p>I think this ought to be a lesson to Churchmen not to put
faith in Governments.&nbsp; The Church can never lose by any
measures which are just, and fair, and straightforward, and
open.&nbsp; And, therefore, the Church had nothing to lose from
the &ldquo;religious profession&rdquo; clause of the Census
Bill.&nbsp; But as Governments do not bind themselves to keep
their faith, and are always ready to sacrifice their convictions
of justice to their lust of power, the Church must have no trust
in Governments.</p>
<p>The object of this tract is not affected by the weak and
pitiful conduct of the Government.&nbsp; It never was my object
to defend the &ldquo;religious profession&rdquo; clause.&nbsp; I
have said that, considering the religious distractions of this
country, I think it would be wiser for the Government to leave
the religious profession of the people alone.&nbsp; And I say so
still.&nbsp; Never to have proposed a Census of religious
opinions at all would have been wise.&nbsp; But, to have proposed
it&mdash;to have stoutly maintained the justice of it&mdash;to
have asserted the necessity of it for <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>equitable legislation,&mdash;and
then, to have withdrawn it to satisfy an unreasoning handful of
Dissenters, who make themselves heard in the House of Commons, is
not to be characterized by any negative form of judgment.&nbsp;
This is not simply want of wisdom.&nbsp; It is more like that
moral imbecility which, in men whom <span
class="smcap">God</span> has burdened with a high trust, is
really a crime.</p>
<p>The object of this tract remains.&nbsp; And therefore,
notwithstanding the course which the Government has taken, I send
it forth to effect that object, as opportunity shall be
found.&nbsp; I ask my countrymen and countrywomen&mdash;Christian
men and women&mdash;simply to consider, as in the presence of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, these two appalling facts, which
the discussion of the Census Bill has forced to the surface, in
this day of <i>Crisis</i> for the Truth.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That thousands of baptized souls in England are
content to believe nothing in particular.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That thousands more who protest that they <i>do</i>
believe something in particular, protest also that they cannot
&ldquo;confess&rdquo; that something &ldquo;before
men.&rdquo;</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
